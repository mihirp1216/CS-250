#•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I believe that mastering this ability will take some time. All sorts of modifications may be made through a series of short and easy releases as long as there is an open line of communication with the end-user.

#•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I believe that after learning about agile, I now have the skills I need to deepen my understanding of project management in a variety of settings. In terms of development, I believe that being structured is vital, and agile gives the means to be organized while being flexible and adaptive. Development teams are less constrained by time restrictions and are able to focus more on value-based development, allowing them to consistently meet end-user goals. In the future, I aim to use software technologies like Azure, Jira, and Github in my projects. Daily stand-up meetings and planning poker have also become "favorites" in my development toolbox. Agile removes the overwhelming sensation of massive development projects by focusing attention on little tasks that result in a reliable product at the end. "Slow and steady wins the race!" as the adage goes.

#•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

This is a lesson I acquired while attending a full-stack development bootcamp, and I believe it is essential. In a team, there are many diverse personalities. There will be a lot of different viewpoints, but keep in mind that you're on the same team with the same goal. This isn't a competition to see who a better programmer is or who has more experience. The objective is to provide a finished product. Agile touts itself as a technique that is very adaptive, thus developers must be versatile as well. Team members must be receptive to ideas other than their own and willing to accept differences of opinion. As the team lead for my bootcamp development project, I made sure that everyone on the team had a say, and that whether we agreed or disagreed, each team member had an idea that was integrated in the project. I believe that creating team spirit and improving connections within the team requires trust. Personal development is also crucial since growth is slowed without the ability to create.
